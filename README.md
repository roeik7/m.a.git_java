## **My version control system**

In this project I developed a console application designed to manage projects, pieces of code, </br>
track the history of changes, code versions, and support a variety of commands such as commit changes, branches, checkout, working stage, etc. </br>
The project was done to know the version control system better and how it works. </br>

The application start with a main manu-

In order for the commands to be relevant, an old repository needs to be loaded or a new one to be created.
Currently the option to load repository is using an XML file containing project details (commits, file hierarchy and more).
Example to xml file in the end of the readme.
